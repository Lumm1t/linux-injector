## Overview

linux-injector is the first public shared object injector written with Node. I decided to combine power of Vue and Electron with Shell script, so I created this tool. I tried to keep code clean and bug-free. It is made mostly for CS:GO players who use internal cheats (_yes, it is undetected_). Feel free to contribute and use this code in your open-source projects.

##### It was made using:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [Shell script](https://www.shellscript.sh/)
- [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)

### Prerequisites to build

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

### Prerequisites to run

- Linux operating system

### Getting Started

The use of `node@^7` or higher required. electron-vue also officially recommends the [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.org) package manager as it handles dependencies much better and can help reduce final build size with `yarn clean`.

```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Lumm1t/linux-injector.git
cd linux-injector/
yarn # or npm install
yarn dev # or npm run dev
```

### Building executable

```bash
yarn build # or npm run build
```
